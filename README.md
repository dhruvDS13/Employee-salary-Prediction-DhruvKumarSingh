# Employee Salary Prediction using Gradient Boosting & Ensemble Algorithms

Welcome to the **Employee Salary Prediction** project! This Streamlit app uses Gradient Boosting and Ensemble Algorithms to predict employee salaries based on factors like education, experience, location, job title, age, and gender. Built with love by [Dhruv Singh](https://linkedin.com/in/dhruv-kumar-singh-51a86725a)!

## ✨ Features
- Predict your salary with a single click! 🚀
- Compare top machine learning models with R² scores up to 0.9743! 📊
- Visualize actual vs. predicted salaries with interactive charts! 🎯
- Easy, fast, and fun for everyone! 💖
